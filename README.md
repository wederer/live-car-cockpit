# Live Car Cockpit - A demo project


This was an demo project I built for an application. It should represent live data being sent from a car to a cockpit which visualizes the data.

## How to run

```
cd frontend
npm run build
cd ..
mvn package
java -jar target/live_car_cockpit-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

# open localhost:8080
```
